# to-do-listweb
This project is a simple to-do list web application aimed at providing users with a user-friendly interface to manage their tasks. It allows users to add new tasks, edit existing tasks, mark tasks as completed or uncompleted, and delete tasks. The application utilizes local storage to persist tasks, ensuring that they are retained even after the user closes the browser. The user interface is designed to be responsive and visually appealing, focusing on a seamless and intuitive user experience.

Modules Used and Their Purpose:-

HTML: Provides the structure and content of the web page, including elements for displaying tasks, input fields for adding new tasks, and buttons for interacting with tasks.

CSS (styles.css): Defines the styling and layout of the web page, including the appearance of task elements, input fields, buttons, and overall design aesthetics. It ensures a visually appealing and responsive user interface.

JavaScript (script.js): Implements the core functionality of the to-do list application. This includes handling user interactions such as adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as completed or uncompleted. Additionally, it interacts with local storage to store and retrieve tasks, ensuring persistence across page refreshes.
